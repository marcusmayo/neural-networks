# ðŸš² Bike Rental Prediction with Neural Network & MLOps Pipeline

This project demonstrates how to build, train, test, and deploy a **simple neural network** using **PyTorch**, and automate the entire ML lifecycle with an **MLOps pipeline** using **GitHub Actions**, **Docker**, and **FastAPI**.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Summary

We use a feedforward neural network (multi-layer perceptron) to predict **bike rental counts** based on hourly weather and time features using the [UCI Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).
