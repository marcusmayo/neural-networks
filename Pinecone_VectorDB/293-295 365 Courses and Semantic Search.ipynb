This type of data is encountered on a daily basis when working as a data scientist, and here, you will learn how to build a logistic regression, understand tables, interpret the coefficients of a logistic regression, calculate the accuracy of the model, as well as how to test. We will introduce under and overfitting, and will teach you how to test your models.\n",
