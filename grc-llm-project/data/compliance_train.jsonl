{"instruction": "What is required for SOC 2 CC6.3 access reviews?", "input": "", "output": "SOC 2 CC6.3 requires organizations to authorize, modify, or remove access to data, software, functions, and other protected information assets based on roles and responsibilities. Regular access reviews must be performed to ensure appropriateness of access rights."}
{"instruction": "Does SOC 2 require encryption of data in transit?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, SOC 2 CC6.7 requires the transmission of data and other communications to be protected. This typically includes encryption of sensitive data during transmission using protocols like TLS/SSL."}
{"instruction": "What does ISO 27001 say about access reviews?", "input": "", "output": "ISO 27001 A.9.2.5 requires regular user access rights reviews to ensure appropriateness. Organizations must review access rights at planned intervals and when changes occur, removing or adjusting access that is no longer required."}
{"instruction": "Which ISO 27001 control addresses password management?", "input": "", "output": "ISO 27001 A.9.4.3 covers password management systems. It requires interactive password systems to ensure quality passwords and protect passwords from unauthorized access during transmission and storage."}
{"instruction": "What does ISO 27001 require for incident management?", "input": "", "output": "ISO 27001 A.16.1.1 requires organizations to establish incident management responsibilities and procedures. This includes reporting security events quickly to appropriate management channels and responding to security incidents in a timely manner."}
{"instruction": "How does ISO 27001 address supplier access management?", "input": "", "output": "ISO 27001 A.15.1.1 requires organizations to establish and implement policies for managing information security risks associated with supplier access. Access rights must be defined, documented, and regularly reviewed."}
{"instruction": "What backup requirements does ISO 27001 specify?", "input": "", "output": "ISO 27001 A.12.3.1 requires regular backup copies of information, software and system images. Backup procedures should be regularly tested, and restoration capability verified to ensure business continuity requirements can be met."}
{"instruction": "Do we need encryption at rest for HIPAA?", "input": "", "output": "While HIPAA does not explicitly mandate encryption, it requires appropriate technical safeguards for ePHI. The Security Rule states encryption is 'addressable,' meaning covered entities must implement it or document why an alternative measure is more appropriate. AES-256 encryption at rest is considered a standard implementation."}
{"instruction": "What does HIPAA require for access controls?", "input": "", "output": "HIPAA Security Rule ยง164.312(a)(1) requires implementation of technical policies and procedures that allow only authorized persons to access ePHI. This includes unique user identification, emergency access procedures, automatic logoff, and encryption and decryption capabilities."}
{"instruction": "How does HIPAA address audit logs?", "input": "", "output": "HIPAA Security Rule ยง164.312(b) requires implementation of hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine access and other activity in information systems containing ePHI. Audit logs must be protected from alteration and regularly reviewed."}
{"instruction": "What are HIPAA's requirements for data transmission?", "input": "", "output": "HIPAA Security Rule ยง164.312(e)(1) requires technical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to ePHI transmitted over electronic communications networks. End-to-end encryption is required when ePHI is transmitted over open networks like the internet."}
{"instruction": "Does HIPAA require regular security risk assessments?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, HIPAA Security Rule ยง164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) requires covered entities to conduct regular security evaluations. Organizations must perform periodic technical and non-technical evaluations to ensure security measures continue to be reasonable and appropriate."}
{"instruction": "How do SOC 2, ISO 27001, and HIPAA differ in encryption requirements?", "input": "", "output": "SOC 2 CC6.7 requires protection during transmission but doesn't specify encryption methods. ISO 27001 A.10.1.1 addresses cryptographic controls as needed. HIPAA makes encryption 'addressable' meaning required unless documented alternative exists. All three frameworks generally expect strong encryption for sensitive data."}
{"instruction": "Which frameworks require multi-factor authentication?", "input": "", "output": "SOC 2 CC6.1 requires MFA for privileged access and remote access. ISO 27001 A.9.4.2 covers secure log-on procedures which may include MFA. HIPAA doesn't explicitly require MFA but considers it a reasonable safeguard under access control requirements. SOC 2 has the most explicit MFA requirements."}
