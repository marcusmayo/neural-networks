This control requires organizations to implement logical access security measures, including password policies that enforce complexity, minimum length, and regular rotation. The control ensures that passwords are sufficiently complex to prevent unauthorized access to the system.",

    "What does ISO 27001 say about access reviews?": {
        "answer": "ISO 27001 A.9.2.5 requires regular reviews of user access rights. Organizations must conduct periodic reviews to ensure that access rights remain appropriate and aligned with business needs. The standard recommends formal access reviews at planned intervals and whenever there are significant changes to employment or responsibilities.",

    "Do we need encryption at rest for HIPAA?": {
        "answer": "Yes, HIPAA requires protecting ePHI through appropriate technical safeguards. While encryption at rest is addressable rather than required, it's considered a standard implementation. The Security Rule allows covered entities to implement alternative measures only if they can document that encryption is not reasonable and appropriate for their environment.",

    "What backup requirements does ISO 27001 specify?": {
        "answer": "ISO 27001 A.12.3.1 requires organizations to implement backup procedures for information and software. The standard mandates regular backup of data, testing of backup media, and documented recovery procedures. Backups should be stored securely and tested periodically to ensure data integrity and availability.",
