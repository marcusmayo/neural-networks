Sample Interactions
Query: "How do I submit an invoice?" Response: "Log in to the supplier portal, navigate to Invoices → Create, enter the PO number (if applicable), upload your PDF or XML, review the preview, and click Submit."

Query: "What is the typical approval turnaround time?" Response: "Standard approval takes 3–5 business days after a valid invoice is received. Complex three-way matches or disputes may extend this timeframe."

🚀 Setup & Deployment
Prerequisites
AWS Account with appropriate permissions
Python 3.8+
AWS CLI configured
1. Data Preparation
bash
# Upload training data to S3
aws s3 cp data/instructions.jsonl s3://edenred-invoice-data-ab-20250817/
2. Model Training
bash
# Run the training notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/model_training.ipynb
3. SageMaker Deployment
python
# Deploy model to SageMaker endpoint
from sagemaker.huggingface import HuggingFaceModel

model = HuggingFaceModel(
    model_data=model_uri,
    role=role,
    transformers_version="4.17",
    pytorch_version="1.10",
    py_version="py38"
)

predictor = model.deploy(
    initial_instance_count=1,
    instance_type="ml.m5.large",
